## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a classifier that can categorize photographs from a subset of the Fashion-MNIST dataset. This study is important because the ability to perform accurate image classification is a key component of machine learning. Therefore, I will implement four different classification algorithms and compare their performance using their respective optimal hyperparameters.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required Python libraries
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the project's workflow and steps.

## Usage

The project can be used for image classification. You can use the provided notebooks as a guide to develop your image classifier, or you can adapt the code for your specific data analysis tasks.

## Results

The report contains detailed information about the project's outcomes, including model performance metrics, visualizations, and any additional insights gained from the analysis.
